## Git
Git is a software system designed to allow collaborators to simultaneously work on text documents, project data, and computing code for websites and for analyzing data and conducting scientific analyses. Git is a form of *version control*.

## Version control 
Version control is an approach to developing text, data, and code that allows users the ability to examine, comment on, and revert back to any changes within the life of a document. 
In short, version control works when one make changes to a *local* version of a project (code, data, or text), and then *pushing* those changes to one's personal online version. 
Having one's own online version keeps your project (or your version of a group's project) safe from loss or damage.
If working with collaborators, one can then submit a *pull request* for others to check and *pull* the changes into the group's project. 

In short, Git is a version control system allows multiple people in remote locations to work on the same code, data, and text without irretrievably deleting or writing over others' work.

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based service for hosting projects that use the Git version control system. GitHub provides a graphical interface for viewing and managing a project's code, data, and text files, whether in collaboration with others or working individually.

GitHub allows users to *fork* a personal version of a project.
Nowadays, downloading new open-source software is often done by forking a GitHub repository.
Forking immediately creates a copy of a project on your personal GitHub page or other GitHub page that you have permissions.
But, forking does not create a local copy of a project on your local machine.

To create local copies, say, on your laptop, you would need to *clone* the repository.
Cloning a repository can be done via GitHub (the graphical web-interface) or by working with Git directly on your local machine.

##GitHub at Indiana University
IU has an Enterprise GitHub system that is a university managed version of GitHub available to IU faculty, staff, and students.
So, IU basically has basically forked a restricted version of the GitHub project.
IU's Enterprise version GitHub is only visible to members of the IU community. 

## Goals
+ Install and Configure Git
+ Create an GitHub account using IU's GitHub Enterprise
+ Learn what repositories are and they will be used during Quantitative Biodiversity

### Git Installation
If you do not have a current Git installation (already installed in computer lab), please do the following:

1. Naviate to git-scm.com/download/
2. Select the appropriate operating system
3. The download should start automatically
4. Open the installer and follow the onscreen directions

  **On Mac**: You will need to make sure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed.  
  **On Windows**: This process will install Git Bash (msysGit). 
  During installation, you will be asekd to adjust your PATH environment.
  We recommend that you select the option to "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt".
  This will give you the most flexibility with Git.
  In addition, we recommend that during installation you select Use OpenSSH for your secure shell client with GitBash.
  
  During both installation processes you will be asked how to configure the line ending conversions
  **On Mac**: We recommend "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings"
  **On Windows**: We recommend "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"
  However, we will also configure this below and explain line endings.  

### Git Test
Before we get started with Git, we first need to test our current installation to make sure there aren't any issues.
The easiest way to do this is to look up the Git version currently installed.
We will use terminal (GitBash on Windows) to accomplish this.

The first thing we need to do is find and start terminal.
On the lab computers, you can find terminal in the **Utilities Folder**.
On your personal computer: **Mac** you can search for terminal with spotlight [Cmd+Space]; **Windows** you can find GitBash in the Start Menu.

1. Find terminal (or GitBash) and open a new window
2. Type the following commands:

    ```sh
    pwd
    ls
    git --version
    ```

### Git User Setup
1. We recommend that you create a folder in your user directory (> cd ~) called '*GitHub*' to make this and future assignments easier to manage. (**Mac** Users: Do this from Terminal; **Windows** Users: Do this from GitBash)

    ```sh
    cd ~
    mkdir ./GitHub/
    cd ./GitHub
    pwd
    ```
    
2. You will need to configure your local Git installation.
We will do this by entering your name and email. 
We will also set two defaults: push and credential save

    ```sh
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    git config --global push.default simple
    git config --global credential.helper store
    ```
    
3. The last thing you need to do is configure how Git handles line endings.
Line endings are invisible characters that your operating system places at the end of each line in a document.
On Unix machines (e.g. Mac), this is the linefeed character (LF).
On Windows machines, this is the carriage-return (CR) and linefeed (LF) characters.
This difference in line endings between Mac and Windows causes incompatabilities between the two systems.
However, Git is enabled to handle the differences by silently converting line endings when repos are push to remote servers.
We recommend that you configure this behavior in order to prevent any future issues when collaborating across computer platforms.

    **On Mac**

    ```sh
        git config --global core.autocrlf input
    ```

    **On Windows**

    ```sh
        git config --global core.autocrlf true
    ```    
    
**You are now ready to** ***Git !!!***

### Create User with IU's Enterprise GitHub Service
1. Navigate to https://github.iu.edu
2. Sign in with your IU Username and Passphrase
3. On the top right of your screen, click on your Username
4. Click on the Edit Profile Icon to edit your profile<br>

    \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{images/github_edit_btn.png}

### Fork and Clone a Repo
1. Navigate to and click on your student repository (repo) on https://github.iu.edu/2015-QuantitativeBiodiversity
2. Fork your repo by clicking on the Fork Icon in the top right of your screen<br>

    \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{images/github_fork_btn.png}

    You should now see the repo on your GitHub page.

3. Clone the repo onto your local machine using the command line (terminal or GitBash).
Replace [User_Name] and [Repo] with your IU Username and QB Repository.

    ```sh
    cd ~/(Path to GitHub Folders, e.g. ~/GitHub/)
    git clone https://github.iu.edu/[User_Name]/[Repo]
    cd ./[Repo]
    git status
    ```

    The repo should have downloaded onto your local machine and the status should stay "all up to date". You should also see that the only thing in your repo is a file named README.md

4. Check and update remote repo.
The following commands will at your upstream remote repository (located on the QB Course GitHub)

    ```sh
    git remote -v
    git remote add upstream https://github.iu.edu/2015-QuantitativeBiodiversity/[Student Repo]
    git remote -v
    ```
    You can copy and paste the URL for your upstream repo from the GitHub website.

4. Open and edit the README.md file:

    This file is a Markdown file.
    Markdown is markup language for writing and editing text that can be easily converted to other formats (e.g. HTML, PDF, Word).
    We will edit Markdown files using RStudio.
    Open RStudio.
    From RStudio, navigate to and open your README.md file.
    Edit the file as needed (we will demonstrate). 
    Update your '*Student Name*' with your full name. 
    Enter your email address. Write a short Bio about yourself (~ 1 paragraph). 
    List three to five course expectations. 
    Hint: View the Markdown guide to learn about formatting and making ordered lists (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). 
    When you are done, save the close the document.

5. Now we need to add and commit our changes to git

    ```sh
    git status
    git add ./README.md
    git commit -m "Updated README.md with student information"
    ```

6. Now push the changes to GitHub

    ```sh
    git push master
    ```

    You should now see the repo on your GitHub page.

7. Navigate to your GitHub page to make sure that the file was uploaded correctly. If so, submit a Pull Request to submit your file to the course <br>

    \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{images/github_pr_btn.png}
  
    The course instructors can now see your work.
    During this course, you will submit all assignments using this method.
    In addition, you will use Git and GitHub to contribute to project in class and on your personal computers.
