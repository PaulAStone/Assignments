In this exercise, we provide an introduction to some of the basic features of the R computing environment. We emphasize calcuations, data types, and simple commands that will be useful for you during the course. 

```{r}
print("Hello World")
```

Now, print your own statement
```{r}

```

```{r}
Sys.info()
sessionInfo(package = NULL)
print(sessionInfo(package = NULL), local = FALSE)
system("git --version")

toLatex(sessionInfo(), locale = TRUE)



```
