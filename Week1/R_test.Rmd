During this course, you might find yourself working at home and needing everything to function properly. In this short assignment, we will learn how to print a statement in R. In addition, the second half of this assignment will tell us about your computer, R, and Git environments. 

1. Edit your name in the *author* line above (line 3)

2. Print a message in the R terminal

Ex. Print "*Hello, World!*"
```{r}
print("Hello, World!")
```

Now, print your own statement
```{r}


```

3. Tell us about your system. Basically, just leave this part alone and it will do magic

**Do Not Modify This Part**

```{r}
info <- unname(c(Sys.info()[6],
          .Platform$OS.type,
          Sys.info()[1:2],
          R.version.string,
          .Platform$GUI,
          system("git --version", intern = TRUE)))
info
```
