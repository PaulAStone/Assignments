In this exercise, we will provide an introduction to some of the basic
features of the R computing environment. We emphasize calcuations, data
types, and simple commands that will be useful for you during the
course.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. When you click the
**Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content
as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

SETTING YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY
==============================

    getwd() # prints current working directory

    ## [1] "/Users/lennonj/GitHub/Quantitative_Biodiversity/Assignments/Week1"

    setwd("/Users/lennonj/GitHub/Quantitative_Biodiversity/Assignments/Week1") # set workding dir

USING R AS A CALCULATOR
=======================

1+3 \# addition

3-1 \# subtraction

3\*10\^2 \# multiplication

10/pi \# division using one of R's built-in constants

sin(4) \# trigonometry; simple example of a function (sin) and argument
(4)

log10(100) \# log base 10; another example of function and argument

log(100) \# natural log

DEFINING VARIABLES
==================

\# importance of "assignment" using -\> (vs =) \# importance of sequence
of definintions \# in R studio, see Environment tab

a \<- 10

b \<- a + 20

a \<- 20 \# now, what is b?

mario example with = vs. \<-
============================

\# you can clear variable from R memory in two ways \# 1) rm(list=ls())
\# removes all items in the list 'ls' \# example of calling functions
within functions \# 2) clicking on "clear" in the Environment tab

WORKING WITH SCALARS, VECTORS, AND MATRICES
===========================================

w \<- 5 \# x is a scalar

x \<- c(2,3,6,w,w+7, 12,14) \# x is a vector

help(c) \# What is the function c? the help function is your friend.

y \<- w\*x \# what happens when you multiply a scalar and vector?

z \<- x\*y \# what happens when you multiply two vectors?

z[2] \# reference 2nd element in vector z

z[2:5] \# reference elements 2-5 in vector z

z[2]=583 \# change the value of an element in vector z

sum(z) \# built-in function for taking sum of vector

mean(z) \# built-in function for taking mean of vector

sd(z) \# built-in function for taking standard deviation of vector

sem(z) \# what about standard error of the mean?

sem \<- function(x){ sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)) } \# example of a simple
user-defined function

sum(d,na.rm=T) \# include as good example from Mario; do a logtransofmr
on vector with a zero

\# Three common ways to create a matrix (two dimensional vectors)

\# First way: combine vectors j \<- c(rnorm(length(z),mean=z)) \# create
new vector of random numbers

k \<- cbind(z,j) \# use cbind to make a matrix from two vectors

\# use 'help' function to learn about cbind

\# use the 'dim' function to describe the matrix you just created

\# Second way: use matrix function l \<-
matrix(c(2,4,3,1,5,7),nrow=3,ncol=2)

\# Third way: import data m \<-
as.matrix(read.table("matrix.txt",sep="",header=FALSE))

n \<- t(m) \# often we want to transpose matrices, this is easy in R

\# Some ways to subset data in a matrix:

\# Take first three rows: n \<- m[1:3,]

\# Take first two columns: n \<- m[,1:2]

\# Take columns 1, 2, and 5: n \<- m[,c(1:2,5)]
