```{r}
getwd()
setwd("~/GitHub/Quantitative_Biodiversity/Assignments/Week2")

## INSTALL PACKAGES
People develop different packages for certain tasks that can be carried out in 
the R enviornment. 
Use the 'help'funciton to learn about package installation and add-ons.

```{r}
require("vegan")||install.packages("vegan");require("vegan")

```

In the library of vegan, there is a data set that we will be using called BCI. 
BCI stands for Barro Colorado Island, which is a located in Panama. 
The BCI data frame has 50 plots (rows) of 1 hectare with counts of trees on 
each plot with total of 225 species (columns).

We will again be using the BCI data set for part of this weeks exercises
