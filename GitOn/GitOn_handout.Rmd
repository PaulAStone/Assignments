## OVERVIEW
Licensing your code and migrating to a public site, github.com

After completing this exercise you will know how to:

1.  understand differences in licesning code
2.  make your science open via migrating to public github account


## 1) SETUP
### A. Retrieve and Set Your Working Directory

```{r, results = 'hide'}
rm(list = ls())
getwd()
setwd("~/GitHub/QuantitativeBiodiversity/Assignments/GitOn")
```

## 2) LICENSING YOUR CODE  
When setting up public repositories on GitHub, you'll want to license your work because it will be in the public domain. 
Licenses are what establish your legal rights to waive responsibilities/liabilities, to attract copyright, and to establish intellectual primacy. 
Licensing allows us to be fearless; to be protected by putting our ideas and work in the public domain; not by hiding it.

GitHub offers a broad selection of licenses that range from short and tidy (MIT) to long and unintelligible (GPL V3). http://choosealicense.com/. I wrote the database and license portion of this paper written using markdown and GitHub: 9 Simple ways to make it easier to (re)use your data. There's lots of goodies of in it, the repo which is found here:  https://github.com/weecology/data-sharing-paper.

## 3) MIGRATING TO GITHUB.COM
