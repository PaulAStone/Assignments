## OVERVIEW
Licensing your code and migrating to a public site, github.com

After completing this exercise you will know how to:

1.  make your own GitHub repo
2.  create an R source file
3.  understand differences in licesning code
4.  make your science open via migrating to public github account


## 1) MAKING a REPO
So far this semester you have been working with a repo



## 2) CREATE SOURCE CODE FILE
Last week we learned the benefit of using a R source code file. 
As a reminder, a source code file has user-defined functions that are required for certain analyses.
The benefit of source files is that they contain "vetted" code that can be used across multiple projects. 
Last week, that file contained code for importing files created by the popular community sequencing software `mothur` (http://www.mothur.org/).
This week, we will make our own source code file containing code (functions) that we created during QB.

1. Create a blank R file. 
2. In your menu bar, choose File > New File > R Script (alternatively, Ctrl + Shift + N)
3. Add a file header.
This should be a commented out section that give all of the required information for users to use this script.
Additionally, this may contain notes for the user.

Here is an example header:

```{sh}
################################################################################
#                                                                              #
# Quantitative Biodiversity Functions Source Code                              #
#                                                                              #
# Written by: Student X                                                        #
#                                                                              #
# Last update: 2015/03/06                                                      #
#                                                                              #
# Notes:                                                                       #  
#                                                                              #
################################################################################
```

There are a few things to notice about the header:
1. The comment character (#) prevents R from interpreting the information in the header
2. The header is formatted for stylystic purposes; it is 80 characters wide (as should your file), and it is boxed off using comment characters. 
There are other ways of stylizing your header, this is just one option.

4. Add content
A. The first thing you will want to do is add and require commands.
This is a bit different than before because we need to make sure that the packages are installed.
By default, the following code will try to load a package and will then install if not found.

```{sh}
require("vegan")||install.packages("vegan");require("vegan")

```
You can cusotmize this code for any package that you want loaded for our source file

B. Add functions:
The major goal this week is to make a source file that contains all of the functions we wrote this semester.
So now you are going to populate this file with those function.
Go through all of your assignments and find the functions you want to save.
Copy those functions into this new source file. 
Add comments about each function before the code.
For example:

```{sh}
# My_Function: has some cool code
# Inputs: x, y, z

My_Function <- function(x, y, z){
  ...
}

```

Add as many functions are you want. 

## 2) CREATE README

## 2) LICENSING YOUR CODE  
When setting up public repositories on GitHub, you'll want to license your work because it will be in the public domain. 
Licenses are what establish your legal rights to waive responsibilities/liabilities, to attract copyright, and to establish intellectual primacy. 
Licensing allows us to be fearless; to be protected by putting our ideas and work in the public domain; not by hiding it.

GitHub offers a broad selection of licenses that range from short and tidy (MIT) to long and unintelligible (GPL V3). http://choosealicense.com/. I wrote the database and license portion of this paper written using markdown and GitHub: 9 Simple ways to make it easier to (re)use your data. There's lots of goodies of in it, the repo which is found here:  https://github.com/weecology/data-sharing-paper.

## 3) MIGRATING TO GITHUB.COM
