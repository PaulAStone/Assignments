## OVERVIEW
In this exercise, we will add spatial context to the concepts of alpha ($\alpha$) and beta ($\beta$) by considering how diversity can vary as a function of distance and area. 
After introducing core concepts of aggregation and spatial autocorrelation, we will explore spatially implicit and explicit patterns of biodiversity. 

After completing this exercise you will know how to:

1.  Use control structures such as `loops` to control how R operates on variables.
2.  Examine the extent to which patterns of biodiversity are dependent on spatial scale.
3.  Examine the effect of geographic distance on the similarity of environmental conditions and community composition.
4.  Quantify, compare, and interpret the distribution of abundance and richness across space.


## 1) SETUP
### A. Retrieve and Set Your Working Directory

```{r, results = 'hide'}
rm(list=ls())
getwd()
setwd("~/GitHub/QuantitativeBiodiversity/Assignments/GeographicalEcology")
```

### B. Load Packages 
We will use the `vegan` and `BiodiversityR` packages for biodiversity estimators and related functions.

```{r, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE} 
library("vegan")
library("BiodiversityR")
```

We will also use a package developed in R for geographical information systems (GIS).
This package will allow us to generate maps, project diversity data onto environmental layers, and conduct geographical analyses.

```{r}
library(RgoogleMaps)
```

***Question 1***: Identify two ways that the library() function differs from require(). 

> ***Answer 1***:

##I THINK YOU MISINTERPRETTED A QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU; I WASN'T SUGGESTING THIS AS A STUDENT QUESTION


## 2) LOADING DATA
We will analyze environmental and bacterial community data from a survey of shallow ponds found east of Bloomington, Indiana.
These ponds are scattered throughout Brown County State Park, Yellowood State Forest, and Hoosier National Forest.
In the 1940s, Maury Reeves of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources began constructing refuge ponds for wildlife.
In the summer of 2013, we visited approximately 50 of these ponds and recorded their geographic locations using a GPS unit; 'GPS' is the acronym for Global Positioning System.
The ponds were sampled for water chemistry, physical properties, and bacterial community composition.

In this exercise will work with the site-by-species matrix for this dataset as well as accounting for the environmental differences and geography.

Let's begin by loading an image of one of these ponds.
```{r}
#![pond](./data/pond.JPG)
```

***Question 2***: The image of this pond should provoke thoughts of the processes, mechanisms, and dynamics driving biodiversity of various communities and populations. 
As a thought exercise, speculate on what you would expect to find in terms of the biodiversity of this pond, and why.

> ***Answer 2***: 
 
##CONSIDER SKIPPING QUESTION 2, ABOVE


## 3) MAKE A MAP
In this section of the exercise, we are going to use R to generate a map of the refuge ponds using **Google Maps**.
First, we will retrieve a map of Indiana using the `GetMap` function in the package `RgoogleMaps`.
Then, we will generate a map in RStudio that is centered on Brown County, Indiana (39.1 degrees latitude, -86.3 degrees longitude).

```{r}
newmap <- GetMap(center = c(39.1,-86.3), zoom = 10, destfile = "Brown_Co_map.png", maptype="terrain")
PlotOnStaticMap(newmap, zoom = 10, cex = 2, col='blue') # Plot map in RStudio

Ponds <- read.table(file="BrownCoData/20130801_PondDataMod.csv", head=TRUE, sep=",")
lats <- as.numeric(Ponds[, 3]) # latitudes (north and south)
lons <- as.numeric(Ponds[, 4]) # longitudes (east and west)
PlotOnStaticMap(newmap, lats, lons, cex=1, pch=20, col='red', add = TRUE)
# Use the help() function to learn about GetMap and PlotOnStaticMap. 
```

***Question 3***: Based on the map you generated, what do you notice about the spatial distribution of the refuge ponds?

> ***Answer 3***: 


##THERE'S A BIT OF A ROUGH TRANSITION BETWEEN INTRODUCING PONDS AND TRANSITIONING TO "PLINKO"...WE SHOULD TRY TO KEEP THINGS WOVEN TOGETHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN


## 4) PRIMARY CONCEPTS OF GEOGRAPHIC ECOLOGY

### A. Concept 1: Spatial Aggregation
Spatial aggregation refers to the tendency for things to cluster in space, i.e. to be under-dispersed. There are many ecological reasons to expect individuals to be aggregated. 
Resources and environmental conditions are often aggregated and patchy. 
Individuals closely associate for protection and reproductive opportunities, and respond to sociobiological pressures to form groups, family units, and colonies.

However, stochastic models also predict aggregation based on various scenarios of random movement and placement. 
Consider a scenario where individuals enter an environment from a central upstream location and then move downward, veering randomly left and right until they arrive at at downstream edge. Run the following code to see a demonstration of this scenario.

If you attempt to Knit this file, you must comment out this chunk.
##PROBABLY JUST LEAVE OUT OF THE EXERCISE. 
##PERHAPS NOT PUT INTO R CHUNK OR COMMENT IT OUT SINCE IT'S NOT COING TO KNIT
```{r}
#library(animation)
#ani.options(interval = 0.1, nmax = 200)
#quincunx()
```

This example is referred to as the Galton Board or "Bean Machine", and demonstrates how the randomly descending individuals aggregate in a way that approaches a normal distribution.

***Question 4***: Can you think of other ways in which random movement/placement could produce spatial aggregation? 
Why might it be important to consider that aggregation can occur in scenarios where each individual movement cannot be reliably predicted, but where the general outcome can?

> ***Answer 4***: 

***Question 5***: It may be of no surprise that spatial aggregation is common. 
But, under what scenarios would you expect a uniform distribution, e.g., nearly equal distances between all individuals?

> ***Answer 5***:

##COMBINE QUESTIONS 4 AND 5. TRY TO MAKE A BIT MORE CONCRETE?

### B. Concept 2: Spatially Explicit and Implicit Treatment of Data
In the previous demonstration, many individuals aggregated around the center of the x-axis. 
Consequently, our knowledge of where the aggregation occurred was **explicit**. 
But, because we did not track the location of each individual, our knowledge of where any individual ended up, was **implicit**. 
That is, the pattern of aggregation implies that an individual drawn at random will have likely ended up somewhere near the center.

In short, if the location of some unit (e.g., individuals, patches) is known and is examined or modeled, then our analysis or model is spatially explicit with regards to that unit. 
While our Galton Board, was spatially implicit with regards to individuals, we were able to track which locations were becoming aggregated and so, was spatially explicit in regards to "patches".

When accounting for space and location in your own research, you'll need to know whether you are dealing with a spatially implicit or explicit problem/hypothesis and whether you need a spatially explicit or implicit analysis/model.

***Question 6***: In considering our microbial data from the refuge ponds, what is our data (and probably our questions) spatially explicit and implicit in regards to?

> ***Answer 6***: 

## AGAIN, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONSIDER FLOW AND TRANSITIONS. CONCEPTS OF SPATIALLY IMPLICIT AND EXPLICITY MAY BE IMPORTANT BUT AT THIS STAGE MAY SEEM DISJOINT FROM THE PONDS. MAYBE THE PONDS DATA SET DOESN'T NEED TO BE INTRODUCED UNTIL IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE USED. 

### Concept 3: Spatial Autocorrelation
Aggregation is one of the most common features of any natural system. 
Another is spatial autocorrelation, that is, the degree to which a set of spatial features and their associated data values tend to be clustered together in space (positive spatial autocorrelation) or dispersed (negative spatial autocorrelation). 
Tobler's ##YEAR?## first law of geography is a formulation of the concept of spatial autocorrelation made by the geographer Waldo Tobler (1930-). 
This law states that "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."

When analyzing spatial data, it is important to check for autocorrelation. 
If there is evidence of spatial autocorrelation, then one of the underlying assumptions of your analysis may be violated and your results may be biased and invalid.

Addressing spatial autocorrelation leads to more robust and replicable results.  
Analysis of spatial autocorrelation can be broken down into steps: detecting, describing, and **adjusting/predicting -- these things don't really seem all that similar --jtl **

### i. Detecting spatial autocorrelation##
*Moran's I* and the *Mantel test* are commonly used indicators of spatial autocorrelation. 
##Mantel test is more general that what it's being said it to be used for ##
Both will indicate if your spatial autocorrelation is positive or negative and provide a p-value for the level of autocorrelation. 
Both *Moran's I* and the *Mantel test* test against the null that there is no spatial autocorrelation. 
Moran's I does this with a correlation that is weighted by inverse distances, while the Mantel test examines the correlation between two distance matrices and generating a null distribution for this correlation by randomly permuting one of the matrices.
##fix grammar in last sentence##

Let's calculate **Moran's I** for one of our environmental variables
```{r}
#install.packages("ape")
library(ape)

# first, generate a distance matrix,
ponds.dists <- as.matrix( dist( cbind(lons, lats)))

# then take inverse of the matrix values
ponds.dists.inv <- 1/ponds.dists

# then replace the diagonal entries with zeros
diag(ponds.dists.inv) <- 0

# Let's check what we've done
ponds.dists.inv[1:5, 1:5]

# We can now calculate Moran's I using the command Moran.I. 
ponds.dists.inv[is.infinite(ponds.dists.inv)] <- 0
Moran.I(Ponds$Temp, ponds.dists.inv)
```

##NOTE THAT MANTEL TESTS WERE DONE LAST WEEK FOR BETADIVERSITY
##WE USED MANTEL TESTS FROM `VEGAN`; should we use those again? Reason to use a new pacakge for this?
##WHAT ABOUT PARTIAL MANTEL TESTS TO TEASE APART ENV AND GEO?

Next, let's calculate **Mantel's test** for the same environmental variable
```{r}
#install.packages("ade4")
library(ade4)

ponds.dists <- dist(cbind(lons, lats))
env.dists <- dist(Ponds$Temp)

# Checking the upper left corner of our results
as.matrix(ponds.dists)[1:5, 1:5]
as.matrix(ponds.dists)[1:5, 1:5]

#ponds.dists.inv[is.infinite(ponds.dists.inv)] <- 0
mantel.rtest(ponds.dists, env.dists, nrepet = 9999)
```

### ii. Describing and Visualizing Autocorrelation##
Here, we will generate a **variogram** for our pond data. 
##species data or enviromental data???##
A variogram (or semi-variogram) gives you a sense of the degree and range of spatial autocorrelation in your data and how it changes over distances.

**Semi-variance:** A measure of the dispersion of all observations that fall below the mean or target value of a data set. 
Semivariance is an average of the squared deviations of values that are less than the mean. 
Semivariance is similar to variance; however, it only considers observations below the mean.

##BETTER INTERRATED CONCEPTS AND TEXT

```{r}
#install.packages("geoR")
library(geoR)

dists <- dist(cbind(lats, lons))
summary(dists)

breaks = seq(0, 1.5, l = 11)
v1 <- variog(coords = cbind(lats,lons), data = Ponds$Temp, breaks = breaks)

v1.summary <- cbind(c(1:10), v1$v, v1$n)
colnames(v1.summary) <- c("lag", "semi-variance", "# of pairs")
v1.summary

plot(v1, type = "b", main = "Variogram: Temp") 

```

### Concept 4: Scale-Dependence

### SEEMS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING AFTER "SCALE-DEPENDENCE" ABOVE. OF WHAT?
### SECTIONS BELOW SEEM LIKE THEY NEED TO BE FILLED OUT. 

**i. extent and grain**


**ii. How interpretation can change with extent** 

Here, we generate a single sample of data based on a random draw from a normal distribution (a.k.a., Gaussian distribution, bell curve). 
While all the points were randomly drawn from the same distribution, zooming in and out to different extents reveals what we would very likely call different patterns of aggregation.

```{r}
# generate the data
set.seed(20111105)
x = rbind(matrix(rnorm(10000), ncol = 2), local({
  r = runif(10000, 0, 2 * pi)
  0.5 * cbind(sin(r), cos(r))
}))

x = as.data.frame(x[sample(nrow(x)), ])

plot(x, pch = ".") # The distribution of points is clearly aggregated around the center of the graph (i.e. V1 = 0, V2 = 0)

plot(x, xlim = c(-1, 1), ylim = c(-1, 1)) # Zooming in, our first guess would not be that these points were drawn from a normal distribution. In fact, they look more randomly distributed than aggregated. Of course, they WERE randomly distribution...according to the Gaussian distribution
```

## 5) PRIMARY SPATIAL PATTERNS OF BIODIVERSITY
Having covered the core concepts of geographical (or spatial) ecology, let's explore some of the primary patterns used to quantify and study the geographic distribution of biodiversity. 

### Spatially implicit patterns of aggregation and diversity

**i. Spatial abundance distribution**

Load the site-by-OTU matrix for samples taken from ponds in and around Brown County, Indiana.

```{r}
# Site by OTU matrix
OTUs <- read.csv(file="BrownCoData/SiteBySpecies.csv", head=TRUE, sep=",")
otu.names <- names(OTUs)
OTUs <- as.data.frame(OTUs[-1]) # remove first column (site names)
Site.N <- as.vector(rowSums(OTUs)) # no. reads
```

Now, let's construct **kernel-density curves** for the distribution of abundance among individual OTU's across the refuge pond dataset.
##KERNEL DENSITY CURVES ARE INTRODUCED HERE, BUT WITHOUT EXPLANATION; ACTUALLLY DESCRIBED WELL BELOW. REORGANIZE?

**Introducing loops** 
##IS THIS JUST A NOTE FOR US OR ARE YOU PLANNING TO EXPAND?##

```{r}
ad <- c(0,0)
otu <- 1
while (length(ad) <= 10){
  otu <- sample(1:length(OTUs), 1)
  
  ad <- OTUs[, otu]
  ad = as.vector(t(x = ad))
  ad = ad[ad > 0]
  }
  
plot(density(ad), col = 'magenta', main = otu.names[otu])  
```

As you can see, sampled abundance for a given OTU is often aggregated, revealing many sites where the OTU is relatively rare and many where it is relatively more common.
This type of uneven spatial distribution of abundance is exceptionally common in ecological systems, and is often referred to as the **species spatial abundance distribution (SSAD)**.

***Question 1***: In the site-by-species matrix, each row represents a site and each column represents an OTU. 
If the SSAD is generated by considering all rows for a single column, then what do we obtain when we consider all columns for a given row? 
Have we examined this sort of data structure before? 
If so, elaborate?

> ***Answer 1***: 

##I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING ORGANIZATION. PERHAPS STILL FILLING IN THE DETAILS?

**ii. Abundance-occupancy relationship** (i.e. more abundant species tend to be found in more loations)


**iii. Occupancy-frequency distribution** (many sites with relatively few taxa, few sites with relatively very many taxa, usually)


### Spatially explicit patterns of beta-diversity

**i. Species-level:** Do near sites have more similar (relative) abundances than far sites?

**ii. Distance-decay relationship:** Do near communities have greater similarity than far communities? 

```{r, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#install.packages("simba")
library(simba)
```

Sometimes, code and comments require 40 or so lines. C'est la vie.

##DOESN'T APPEAR THAT EnvData IS DEFINED YET; CAUSING ERROR WHEN KNITTING FOR ME -- JTL

```{r}
# calculate the similarity (Bray-Curtis) between the plots
struc.dist <- 1 - vegdist(OTUs) 
# calculate geographical distance between plots
coord.dist <- dist(as.matrix(lats,lons))

# transform environmental data to numeric types
temp <- as.numeric(EnvData[, "Temp"])
elev <- as.numeric(EnvData[, "Elevation"])
depth <- as.numeric(EnvData[, "Depth"])
doc <- as.numeric(EnvData[, "DOC"])

# calculate the distance (Euclidean) between the plots regarding environmental variables
env.dist <- 1 - vegdist(cbind(temp, elev, depth, doc), "euclidean")

# transform all distance matrices into list format:
struc.dist.ls <- liste(struc.dist, entry="struc")
env.dist.ls <- liste(env.dist, entry="env")
coord.dist.ls <- liste(coord.dist, entry="dist")

# create a data frame containg plot information, geographical distance, 
# similarity of environment, and similarity of community
df <- data.frame(coord.dist.ls, env.dist.ls[,3], struc.dist.ls[,3])
names(df)[4:5] <- c("env", "struc")
attach(df) #df <- subset(df, struc != 0)

# plot Distance-Decay relationships with regression lines in red
par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
plot(dist, env)
abline(lm(env ~ dist), col="red4")

par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
plot(dist, struc)
abline(lm(struc ~ dist), col="red4")

# Is the slope significantly different?
diffslope(dist, env, dist, struc)
```

### Cumulative patterns

**i. Species-area relationship (SAR):** 

The species-area relationship (SAR) describes the rate at which we discover or accumulate species with increasing area. 
The general relationship of the SAR ... and is of the form S=c*A^z ... which was first predicted by Arrhenius (1921)...wow, that's old.

### Random accmulation of sites
Do we accumulate species with greater area just because there is more area or because greater area means more niches?

### Accumulation of sites by proximity

```{r}
OTU.obs <- function(x = ""){
  rowSums(x > 0) * 1
  }
```

## 6) ENTER, THE ENVIRONMENT
##SOME SORT OF DESCIRPTION HERE? OVERVIEW?
## LITLE CONFUSED ABOUT "ENVIRONMENT" SORT OF BEING TACKED ON AT THE END; I'M A BIT CONFUSED BY FLOW. 

### i. Graphically examine environmental data
It is good practice to look at the underlying distribution of your data, before conducting formal statistical tests.
By conducting a simple graphical analysis, we can ask whether our data appear to be normally distributed, highly skewed, multi-modal (i.e. two distinct distributions of data where we might have only expected one).

Let's begin with a simple graphical exploration of the environmental data collected from the refuge ponds.
We will use **kernel density curves**, which are analogous to histograms, but are more appropriate for continuous data because they avoid the arbitrary creation of bins (i.e. bars).
Kernel density curves attempt to account for uncertainty and sampling error, i.e., in revealing the probability that a randomly drawn data point will take a value within a particular range.

**Include units, e.g., degrees C, meters = elevation?, feet!?!? = depth, mg/L = DOC**
```{r}
EnvData <- Ponds[5:21]
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))

data <- as.numeric(EnvData[, "Temp"])
plot(density(data), col = 'magenta', main = "Temperature")

data <- as.numeric(EnvData[, "Elevation"])
plot(density(data), col = 'DarkCyan', main = "Elevation")

data <- as.numeric(EnvData[, "Depth"])
plot(density(data), col = 'darkorchid', main = "Depth")

data <- as.numeric(EnvData[, "DOC"])
plot(density(data), col = 'darkgoldenrod3', main = "DOC")
```

***Question 3***: In the density() function, what does "bandwidth", i.e., "bw" mean? 
##ACTUALLY, THIS WAS A QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU. THAT IS, WE SHOULD EXPLAIN/INTRODUCE. ALSO, SEE COMMENTS ABOVE ABOUT HOW KERNEL-DENSITIES ARE USED ABOVE, BUT THEN FORMALLY INTRODUCED/TAUGHT HERE, MUCH LATER. 

> ***Answer 3***:

***Question 4***: Describe the kernel density plots (think of them as smoothed histograms) of the environmental variables in the refuge ponds.
