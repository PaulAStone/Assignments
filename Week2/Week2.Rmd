In this exercise, we will conduct exercises on alpha diversity

## RETRIEVE AND SET YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY

```{r}
getwd()
#setwd("~/GitHub/Quantitative_Biodiversity/Assignments/Week2")
setwd("/Users/lisalocey/Desktop/Repos/QB/Assignments/Week2")
```

## INSTALL PACKAGES
People develop different packages for certain tasks that can be carried out in the R enviornment. Use the 'help'funciton to learn about package installation and add-ons. install.packages("vegan")

```{r}
require("vegan") #Both of these are not needed
library("vegan")
```

In the library of vegan, there is a data set that we will be using called BCI. BCI stands for Barro Colorado Island, which is a located in Panama. The BCI data frame has 50 plots (rows) of 1 hectare with counts of trees on each plot with total of 225 species (columns)

```{r}
data(BCI)
```

Let's look at the data in the first few plots

```{r}
head(BCI)[,1:3] # MEM: Added column selection so that it didn't print everything.
dim(BCI)  #gives you the dimensions of the data set, (rows, columns)
BCI[1:4,1:6]	#shows the data for rows 1:4 and columns 1:6
```

Calculate Shannon index. 'Margin = 1' means diversity is calculated row-wise; 'Margin = 2' means diversity is calcualted column-wise.With base = exp(1), we are esimating Shannon's index using the natural logrithm of each taxon's relative abundance using the equation; $H' = -{\sum ( p_{i} \times ln(p_{i}))}$

```{r}
shannon <- diversity(BCI, index="shannon", MARGIN = 1, base=exp(1))
```

Can also calculate other diversity metrics

```{r}
simpson <- diversity(BCI, "simpson")
invsimpson <- diversity(BCI, "inv")
fisher <- fisher.alpha(BCI)
``` 

Let's plot ***Pairs is not a normal plotting tool, introduce first***

```{r}
pairs(cbind(shannon, simpson, invsimpson, fisher), pch="+", col="blue")
```

Species richness

```{r}
S <- specnumber(BCI)
```

Rarefaction

```{r}
(raremax <- min(rowSums(BCI)))
Srare <- rarefy(BCI, raremax)
plot(S, Srare, xlab = "Observed No. of Species", ylab = "Rarefied No. of Species")
abline(0, 1)
rarecurve(BCI, step = 20, sample = raremax, col = "blue", cex = 0.6)
```

Example: http://www.jennajacobs.org/R/rarefaction.html

Calculating relative abundances
```{r}
BCI_t <- t(BCI)

BCIrel <- BCI_t
for(i in 1:ncol(BCI_t)){
  BCIrel[,i] = BCI_t[,i] / sum(BCI_t[,i])
  }
```

What's one way to test that this worked?
```{r}
colSums(BCIrel)
```

Now let's create a rank abundance curve. First, let's rank taxa within a sample (site 1) by relative abundance

```{r}
rad <- BCIrel[order(BCIrel[,1], decreasing=TRUE), ]
head(rad)
```

Let's make a ranking now that species abundances are ordered/sorted 

```{r}
ranks <- seq(1,nrow(rad))
```

Let's create RAD plot

```{r}
plot(ranks,rad[,1],type='l',col="black",xlab="Rank",lwd=8,ylab="Relative Abundance",xlim=range(ranks))
```
